## Commercial support { #commercial-support }

Need help with your commercial BeeWare project?

Although BeeWare is an open source project, there are companies and individuals who can provide paid support, training, and consulting.

Note that the core team will *not* provide free support or debugging help for commercial projects. If you're not able to post your question on a public forum due to the content being commercially sensitive, you'll need to seek out someone willing to provide commercial support to meet for your needs.

Contact <consulting@beeware.org> for any inquiries about these services.

## Reporting security issues
