## Community communication channels
If you have a general question about BeeWare usage, we have a number of
options where you can ask for assistance.

We use [Discord](https://beeware.org/bee/chat) for real-time communication.

Follow [@beeware@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@beeware) on
Mastodon for day-to-day updates on the BeeWare project.

Want to receive updates, hints, tips, and announcements related to
BeeWare? [Sign up for the BeeWare Enthusiasts mailing
list](https://eepurl.com/b2Xb4z).

A lot of project-specific communication happens on the GitHub Issues for each project. Links for our high-profile projects can be found on our [documentation page](/docs); visit the [GitHub page for the BeeWare organization](https://github.com/beeware) for the full list of repositories.

We also use GitHub Discussions as a forum to discuss projects. If you
have a question about how to use a BeeWare tool, open a discussion
thread in the repository for that tool.

## Getting Help

If you need advice on how to contribute, anyone on the [Core Team](team.md) will
be able to help you.

If you need direct help and don't feel comfortable using a public forum,
please feel free to get in contact with any [Core
Contributor](team.md), either by email, Mastodon, or
Discord.

However, be aware that if your question *can* be asked in a public
forum, it should be. This ensures that as many people as possible are
able to benefit from any answer that is given - if you're having a
problem, it's highly likely someone else is having the same problem.

In addition, the core team will *not* provide free support or debugging
help for commercial projects. If you're not able to post your question
on a public forum, you'll need to seek out someone willing to provide
[commercial support](/community/) to meet for your needs. TODO: Reword or relink

## Commercial support

Need help with your commercial BeeWare project?

Although BeeWare is an open source project, there are companies and
individuals who can provide paid support, training, and consulting.

Contact <consulting@beeware.org> for any inquiries about these services.

## Reporting security issues

If you want to report a security problem with one of the BeeWare tools,
please contact the [Core Team](team.md).

## Reporting Code of Conduct issues
If you have had an uncomfortable experience in a BeeWare community space, or want
to report a behavior problem with someone who is a member of the
BeeWare community, the [Core Team](team.md) will be happy to manage
your report in accordance with our [Code of Conduct reporting guide](../community/code-of-conduct.md).

For all media enquiries, please contact Founding Apiarist [Russell Keith-Magee](mailto:russell@beeware.org) or Senior Apiarist [Philip James](mailto:philip@beeware.org).
