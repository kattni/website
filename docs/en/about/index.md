## Meet Brutus

![Brutus the Bee](../images/brutus.png)

Brutus the Bee is the mascot of the BeeWare project. He's a busy little
worker bee.

Fun fact: a person who keeps bees is called an **apiarist** - a name
that the BeeWare project uses to describe the core team. This also
reflects the relationship that the core team wishes to have with the
community - we're shepherds of the community, and we'll provide
direction, but we know the real work is done by the community as a
whole.
