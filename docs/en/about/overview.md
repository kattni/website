## Meet Brutus

![Brutus the Bee](../images/brutus.png)

Brutus the Bee is the mascot of the BeeWare project. He's a busy little worker bee.

Fun fact: a person who keeps bees is called an **apiarist** - a name that the BeeWare project uses to describe the core team. This also reflects the relationship that the core team wishes to have with the community - we're shepherds of the community, and we'll provide direction, but we know the real work is done by the community as a whole.

## A first-timer's introduction to BeeWare

Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces.

The end goal of the BeeWare project: To be able to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that Django has done for web software - to put into the hands of users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices. This includes:

- Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,
- Tools to package a Python project, so it can run on those devices,
- Libraries to access the native widgets and capabilities of devices,
- Tools to help develop, debug, analyze and deploy these projects.

The aim is that this set of tools will be easy enough to use for complete newcomers to use in a Django Girls-like setting; but powerful enough that they could be used to drive the next Instagram, Pinterest or Disqus.

We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.
