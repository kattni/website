Amber Brown pretends to be an owl on the internet. When she's not releasing or working on Twisted, she works on software for various commercial and non-profit companies. She's so good at talking endlessly about Twisted that Russell even once invited her to keynote on it.

Also, she likes people tweeting pictures of owls at her.
