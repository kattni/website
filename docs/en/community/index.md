## [BeeWare Community Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) { #code-of-conduct }

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

The guidelines within and enforcement of the [BeeWare Community Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) apply equally to everyone participating in the BeeWare community, including members of the Code of Conduct Response Team.

## Where is the BeeWare community?

We're a globally distributed online community, composed primarily of volunteers. While some of the core team are paid to work on BeeWare, the project is independently managed.

The primary place to find us is on our online forums: [Discord](https://beeware.org/bee/chat) and [GitHub](https://github.com/beeware). If you're looking for an informal way of keeping up to date, we are on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@beeware) and have a [mailing list](https://eepurl.com/b2Xb4z).

We will from time to time also appear at [events](../news/events.md), in particular, regional PyCons. If the opportunity arises, we speak and [sprint](../contributing/sprint-guide.md) at those events. There's also presentations on YouTube, and podcasts, where we talk about the BeeWare project.

There is a group that [sponsors](../membership/index.md) the project financially by becoming [members](../membership/index.md#current-members).
