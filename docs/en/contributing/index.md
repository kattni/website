# Contributing

The project maintainers love collaborating, especially with new contributors, and will gladly answer any questions or walk you through any problems you may encounter.

Intro paragraph: BeeWare is an open source project, and it is only as good as the people who contribute to it; decisions are made by those who show up.

## All Contributions Welcome TODO: remove header and merge into intro paragraph?

It's not just about code. A successful software project requires
documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The BeeWare
community acknowledges that all contributions are important - not just
the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.

## Can I contribute?

Yes! We have opportunities for folks at every experience level to contribute. Whether this is your first time contributing to open source, or you've been doing it for years, we have something that will work for you.

Is this your first time contributing to an open source project? We're here to help! We have [advice for first-time contributors](first-time-contributors.md) to help with getting past any initial fears and concerns.

## Contribution guide

[Contribution guide](contribution_guide/index.md).

## Sprint guide

Are you joining the BeeWare project at a **sprint**? A sprint is an
unstructured gathering where we work on BeeWare and related projects,
and introduce new contributors to the contribution process. If this is
your first time sprinting, BeeWare has a [guide for getting started with
BeeWare sprints](sprint_guide.md).

## Challenge coins

Challenge Coins are a military tradition, which is said to originate at
the start of last century. They were distributed based on merit in
events or for other reasons, and hold deep personal value.

To find out more about Challenge Coins, you can listen to the [99%
Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/coin-check/) podcast
about them, or read up about them on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin).

The BeeWare Challenge Coins are die-cast, 4.5cm (1 3/4") in diameter,
and are made of a nickel/zinc alloy with enamel highlights.

Any contribution to the BeeWare project earns you a coin.

It doesn't have to be a code contribution: a documentation update
counts. A blog post. Helping someone during a sprint with their
contribution.

And as an additional incentive, for those people who help others get
their challenge coins, we have a second coin: the Yak Herder

The first run of 100 BeeWare Challenge Coins were commissioned thanks to
financial support from [MaxCDN](/community/members/maxcdn/). They also
wrote an [article about
BeeWare](https://web.archive.org/web/20170923205703/https://www.maxcdn.com/blog/beeware-be-sticky/)
on their blog.

[Revolution Systems](/community/members/revsys/) provided the funding
for the second pressing of the BeeWare challenge coins.

[GitHub](/community/members/github/) provided the funding for the first
pressing of the BeeWare Yak Herder challenge coins.
