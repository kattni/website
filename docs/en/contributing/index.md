# Contributing

We want to see folks not only using BeeWare, but actively contributing to its development. BeeWare is an open source project, and it is only as good as the people who contribute to it; decisions are made by those who show up. We want to get you involved with BeeWare in whatever way works for you. The project maintainers love collaborating, especially with new contributors, and will gladly answer any questions or walk you through any problems you may encounter.

## Can I contribute?

Yes! We have opportunities for folks at every experience level to contribute. Whether this is your first time contributing to open source, or you've been doing it for years, we have something that will work for you.

It's not just about code. A successful software project requires documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The BeeWare community acknowledges that all contributions are important - not just the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.

Is this your first time contributing to an open source project? We're here to help! We have [advice for first-time contributors](first-time-contributors.md) to help with getting past any initial fears and concerns.

## [Contribution guide](guide/index.md)

There are plenty of ways to contribute to BeeWare. The [contribution guide](guide/index.md) covers everything you need to know to provide your contribution.

## [Sprints](sprint-guide.md) { #sprints }

Are you joining the BeeWare project at a **sprint**? A sprint is an unstructured gathering where we work on BeeWare and related projects, and introduce new contributors to the contribution process. If this is your first time sprinting, BeeWare has a [guide for getting started with BeeWare sprints](sprint-guide.md).

### [Challenge coins](challenge-coins.md) { #challenge-coins }

We also have a [special gift](challenge-coins.md) for anyone who contributes at a sprint.

Any contribution at any time entitles you to a challenge coin, however we can generally only hand them out at in-person events.
