    <nospell>Tkinter</nospell> - the Python wrapper to the <nospell>Tk</nospell> graphics library - has been part
    of the Python standard library since very early on. However, that
    inclusion hasn't translated into extensive use.

    There was a very good reason for this. <nospell>Tk's</nospell> documentation was beyond
    awful. And if you managed to get over that hurdle, <nospell>Tkinter</nospell> apps looked
    awful - they had a woefully inadequate set of widgets, styled with the
    very best of mid 1990's open source graphic skill.

    And then, the world got obsessed with web frameworks, and the desktop
    was declared as dead.

    However, in the last few years, many of the reasons <nospell>Tkinter</nospell> was ignored
    have been quietly fixed. <nospell>Tk</nospell> 8.4 massively improved the visual appearance
    of <nospell>Tk</nospell>. tkdocs.com has emerged, addressing many of the problems with <nospell>Tk</nospell>
    documentation.

    In this talk, you'll get a re-introduction to an old friend, and an
    explanation of why, in a web and mobile world, you should care.
