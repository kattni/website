  title: 'Apple and the Serpent: Writing native applications for Apple platforms in Python'

    Everyone knows you can write iOS, OS X, tvOS and watchOS apps using
    Objective-C and Swift, Apple's officially blessed technologies. But what
    if you want to use a different language? What if you've got an existing
    codebase in a different language, or want to us a language that is more
    approachable to people without a background in programming?

    This talk shows how Python can be used as a viable development language
    for Apple platforms. It explores the mechanics of how Python can
    interact with native Apple APIs, and demonstrates some related tools
    that make the process of creating an iOS, OS X, tvOS or watchOS project
    in Python relatively easy.
