    Python is enjoying a surge in popularity due to it's features as a
    language. However, over the last 10 years, mobile platforms have
    increased in importance, and Python doesn't have a good story on these
    platforms. In this talk, Dr Russell Keith-Magee will give a technical
    dive into the work the BeeWare project has been doing to make Python as
    simple to use on Mobile as it is on other platforms.
