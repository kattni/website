  description: |-
    Django is over 10 years old; but the web that it was built for - the
    world of "Web 2.0" - doesn't really exist any more. Yes, we still need
    to rapidly develop database-backed websites, AJAX-enabled, but the
    modern web is faced with new problems and new challenges. Many of those
    challenges involve interacting with devices that aren't desktop
    machines, and platforms that aren't a traditional browser - places where
    Python isn't a first-class citizen.

    Does this mean we have to abandon Django and Python for other frameworks
    and languages? Can we keep using Python and Django on the server side
    and interact with independent client side frameworks? Or can we push
    Python and Django into these new environments?

    In this talk, Dr Russell Keith-Magee will explore the problems, and the
    potential solutions, to these problems.
