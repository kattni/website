  description: "We\u2019re familiar with Python as a scripting language, as a web server\nlanguage, as a data analysis language, and as a teaching language. But\nis that the limit of where Python can be used? What is the future for\nPython on other platforms? Is the prospect of using Python on those\nplatforms a novelty, or a viable way to fend off an existential threat\nto the language? And how does this threat intersect with other threats\nwe have to our community, and to our industry?"
