    Despite many differences, the popular platforms that have emerged over
    the last 10 years have one thing in common: they all promote programming
    language monocultures. The platform manufacturers provide a single
    language, and strongly encourage all developers to use that one language
    for all projects - Javascript for browsers; Objective C (or Swift) for
    iOS; and Java for Android.

    The open source world is populated with a wide range of programming
    languages. Object oriented and Functional, scripting and compiled,
    mainstream and experimental - there is an almost endless supply of
    options, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, strengths and
    weaknesses. However, they've largely remained tied to traditional server
    environments.

    Is it possible to break the language monoculture, and port existing open
    source languages to these new hardware platforms platforms? Thankfully,
    the answer is yes. The BeeWare project has successfully ported Python to
    browsers, phones, tablets, set top boxes and watches. Although the
    specific implementations of the BeeWare project are Python specific, the
    general approaches taken could be applied to any language.

    In this presentation, you'll be introduced to the task of porting
    languages to a new platform, and the various approaches that can be
    used, depending on the restrictions that a particular platform may
    impose.

  title: Javascript is Awe-ful

    JavaScript is an incredibly powerful language, and thanks to its
    renaissance, it now has uses that extend beyond the browser.

    However, being a language that's extremely accessible, with a shallow
    learning curve and large userbase, it's the subject of - at times -
    vitriolic abuse from other language communities.

    Yes, JavaScript was created in a very short timeframe, and there are
    inherent issues with some very early design decisions that can cause
    some grief to developers. However, as the engine that powers the web,
    it's able to prove it's versatility and usefulness. So why the hate?

    In this talk, we will discuss the history of JavaScript, it's future,
    and how some it's 'wat's can be avoided in everyday use in other to
    leverage the power of this universal language. We will also take a short
    tour through over a dozen other languages and some of their quirks, to
    prove how no language is without fault.
