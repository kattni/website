    We all know Python is a powerful and expressive programming language.
    What you may not know is how much of the internals of Python itself is
    exposed for you to use and manipulate.

    In this talk, you'll be introduced to the tools and libraries Python
    provides to manipulate the compilation and execution of Python code. You
    will also see how you can use those tools to target execution
    environments other than the CPython virtual machine.
