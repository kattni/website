  description: |-
    Python is a decades-strong language with a large community, and it has a
    solid foundation on the server, but it doesn't have a good user story in
    the browser... until now.

    The BeeWare project aims to bring Python natively, everywhere. Using a
    combination of the Batavia and Toga projects, we can develop and
    entirely native web experience in Python, no JavaScript required.

    During this talk, you will learn about how the BeeWare project has built
    Batavia, a Python virtual machine in JavaScript; and Toga, a
    multi-platform native API wrapper; a combination of which can be used to
    build an entire web platform in Python only.
