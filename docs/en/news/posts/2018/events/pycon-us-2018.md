  title: Building a cross-platform native app with BeeWare

    Have you ever wanted to write a GUI application you can run on your
    laptop? What about an app that you can run on your phone? Historically,
    these have been difficult to achieve with Python, and impossible to
    achieve without learning a different API for each platform. But no more.

    BeeWare is a collection of tools and libraries that allows you to build
    cross-platform native GUI applications in pure Python, targeting
    desktop, mobile and web platforms. In this talk, you'll be introduced to
    the BeeWare suite of tools and libraries, and see how you can use them
    to develop, from scratch, a GUI ChatBot application that can be deployed
    as a standalone desktop application, a mobile phone application, and a
    single page webapp - without making any changes to the application's
    codebase.
