    Python has proven itself to be a powerful tool for data science, and for
    web servers. However, one area where it hasn't historically been popular
    is in building applications for end users.

    In this talk, you'll discover how you can use Briefcase to distribute an
    app to users on desktop, mobile, and the web - all from a single Python
    codebase.
