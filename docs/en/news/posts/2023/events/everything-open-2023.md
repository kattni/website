    Python has proven itself to be a powerful tool for data science, and for
    web servers. However, one area where it hasn't historically been popular
    is in building applications for end users.

    In this talk, you'll discover how you can use the BeeWare suite of tools
    to build a GUI app, and deploy that app on desktop, mobile, and the
    web - all from a single Python codebase.
