    No matter the language it's written in, code is only useful if a user
    can interact with it. In this talk, you'll learn about the options that
    exist for building cross-platform GUI interfaces with Python. You'll
    learn about the unique problems that face developers of GUI
    applications, and how to address those problems. You'll also get an
    introduction to Toga, the cross-platform GUI toolkit that is part of the
    BeeWare Project, and to Briefcase, which can be used to deploy apps to
    macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web.
