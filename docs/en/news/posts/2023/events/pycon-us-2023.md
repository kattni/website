    Once you're written your amazing new application using Python, the next
    problem you'll face is how to get that application into the hands of
    users. If your users are familiar with `pip` and and `venv`, you can put pip
    install instructions into a README, and leave it at that. But what if
    your audience aren't Python programmers? What if your app needs to be
    used by people who don't write Python at all? How do you distribute your
    code so that others can use it?

    In this talk, you'll learn about Briefcase, a tool that can convert a
    Python project into platform-native apps on macOS, Windows, Linux - and
    can also target iOS, Android, and the web. You'll learn how to use
    Briefcase to start a new project, or convert an existing project for
    distribution. You'll learn about the features of Briefcase that can
    support you while you develop your application. Finally, you'l learn how
    to generate installers and standalone applications for multiple
    platforms from a single Python codebase.

    By many measures, Android is the most widely-used operating system in
    the world. But Python development on the platform remains quite rare.

    Fortunately there are several active projects working to improve this.
    In this talk, you'll learn about:

    - Why Android support is important for the future of Python.
    - How Android compares to other platforms, and the unique challenges it
      presents.
    - What's needed to make mobile Python development practical, including
      build tools, GUI libraries, and binary package support.
    - The available options for running Python on Android, and how to choose
      which one is best for you.
