    A modern mobile phone isn't just a powerful CPU and display. It's a
    collection of incredibly sophisticated portable sensors: multiple
    cameras, a high resolution GPS, accelerometers and more. In this talk,
    you'll learn how to build and run an app on your phone that can access
    these sensors, using nothing but Python.
