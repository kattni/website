    One of the big features added in Python 3.13 is Tier 3 support for iOS and Android as platforms. This means you can now run Python code that uses the standard library on mobile devices without modification. However, most interesting projects also use code from PyPI... so how do you get that code to run on iOS and Android? How do you even produce a wheel in the first place?
