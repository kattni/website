    All code needs a user interface. That might be an API, or a web page -
    but these days, many users will expect an app that they can install on
    their laptop, or on their phone. But how do you build a native
    application in Python? And do you need to build a different version of
    your app the app for every device and operating system you want to
    support?

    In this hands-on tutorial, you'll lean how you can use the BeeWare suite
    of tools to build a graphical user interface for your code, and deploy
    that code as a desktop app, and as a mobile app - all from a single
    Python codebase. You'll learn how to integrate third-party libraries
    like NumPy into your app, and how to customize the appearance of your
    packaged app. You'll also learn how you can access device hardware (such
    as cameras and GPS) in your app's code.

    No experience with mobile or desktop app development is required; a
    basic familiarity with Python is all you need. By the end of the
    tutorial, you'll have an app running on your own phone, written entirely
    by you, using nothing but Python.

    If you need to build a user interface for your Python code, many guides
    will tell you that your only options are to use the command line, or
    wrap your code in a web interface. However, there is another option -
    building a native GUI interface. In fact for some use cases, a GUI app
    may be your only option.

    In this talk, you'll learn how to build and run a graphical user
    interface (GUI) that can run on your desktop, on your phone, or in a
    browser. You'll learn how you can use the BeeWare suite of tools to
    bootstrap a new GUI project, develop a GUI interface, and deploy that
    app to multiple desktop and mobile platforms, without making any code
    changes. You'll learn how to access device hardware like GPS and
    cameras; and you'll learn how to distribute your application - including
    all runtimes and third-party libraries - to others. Lastly, you'll get a
    brief introduction to how you can access native platform APIs that don't
    have a Python API.
